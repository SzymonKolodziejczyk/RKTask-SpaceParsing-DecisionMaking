# ü§ñ Dynamic NPC Pathfinding System

Welcome to the **Dynamic NPC Pathfinding System**! This project showcases an NPC pathfinding system with customizable behaviors, allowing for smooth and realistic movement along a sequence of nodes. The system is designed to be highly flexible and configurable via **ScriptableObjects** in Unity.

## üìñ About the Project

This system simulates dynamic NPC movement through a series of nodes, providing realistic behaviors such as looking around, pausing for thoughts, and smoothly rotating toward new destinations. The NPC's behaviors are controlled through **ScriptableObjects**, making it easy to configure and extend the system within the Unity Inspector.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### 1. üõ§Ô∏è **Dynamic Pathfinding**
- NPC follows a looping path through a sequence of nodes.
- Continuously moves along the path and interacts with waypoints for specific actions. However, there is a way to make it limited to only go for all the nodes without looping, which is left in the NPCController script.

### 2. üé≠ **Node-Based Actions**
- **Thinking:** The NPC pauses at nodes to display random thoughts.
- **Rotating:** The NPC looks around by rotating at a node.
- Both actions are fully customizable via **ScriptableObjects**, including the probability of each action occurring.
- Additionally, if the chance of the above actions is less than 100%, then the remaining percent goes for the action of doing nothing. A simple and neat way to prevent errors!

### 3. üé≤ **Random Actions While Moving**
- NPC performs subtle "look-around" movements while moving between nodes.
- The random chance for these actions can be configured independently of the node-based behaviors.

### 4. üëÅÔ∏è **Vision Cone**
- A visual representation of the NPC's field of view.
- The vision cone dynamically rotates with the NPC, giving real-time feedback on its awareness.

### 5. üéØ **Smooth Movement & Rotation**
- The NPC smoothly rotates towards its next destination while moving along the path.
- This creates natural and realistic NPC behavior as it navigates the environment.

### 6. üõ†Ô∏è **ScriptableObject Customization**
- Configure the NPC's behavior easily in the Unity Inspector:
  - Set node positions, movement speed, and the probability of random actions.
  - Adjust the chance for each node-based action (thinking, rotating).
  - Modify NPC pathfinding parameters and dynamic behaviors.

### 7. üö´ **Non-Stacking Actions**
- Behaviors are managed to prevent overlapping actions.
- Smoothly transitions between actions without conflicting animations or delays.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization Options

Using **ScriptableObjects**, you can tweak various NPC behaviors directly in the Unity Inspector:
- **Node Positions:** Define custom paths for the NPC.
- **Movement Speed:** Control how fast the NPC moves between nodes.
- **Action Probabilities:** Configure the likelihood of "thinking" or "rotating" actions at nodes.
- **Look-Around Actions:** Set the probability for random look-around behaviors while moving.
- **Vision Cone Parameters:** Adjust the NPC's field of view for different scenarios.
